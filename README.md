# Map with Norwegian news sites (2005-21)
This map presents Norwegian news sites geographically, based on the location of their (main) editorial board.

It is produced with QGIS 3.4, and the [qgis2web](https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web) plugin, with some post-editing of the html-, css- and js-files.

## How to use the map?
To open the map, run 'index.html' in your browser.

All news sites are represented with a red dot. Clicking on it will display a pop-up window with the name of the publication and a link to Norwegian Web Archive, displaying indexed versions of the sites front page.
